#' I work with internet-scale data and do my fair share of macro-analyses on
#' vulnerabilities. I use the R [`semver`]() package for most of my work and
#' wanted to blather on a bit about it since it's super-helpful for this work
#' and doesn't get the attention it deserves. `semver` makes it possible to
#' create charts like this:
#'
#' which are very helpful in when conducting exposure analytics.
#'
#' We'll need a few packages to help us along the way:

#+ libs
library(here) # file mgmt
library(semver) # the whole purpose of the blog post
library(rvest) # we'll need this to get version->year mappings
library(stringi) # b/c I'm still too lazy to switch to ore
library(hrbrthemes) # pretty graphs
library(tidyverse) # sane data processing idioms

#' By issuing a `stats` command to a `memcached` instance you can get a full list
#' of statistics for the server. The recent newsmaking DDoS used this feature in
#' conjunction with address spoofing to create 30 minutes of chaos for GitHub.
#'
#' I sent a `stats` command (followed by a newline) to a vanilla `memcached`
#' installation and it returned 53 lines (1108 bytes) of `STAT` results that look
#' something like this:
#'
#'     STAT pid 7646
#'     STAT uptime 141
#'     STAT time 1520447469
#'     STAT version 1.4.25 Ubuntu
#'     STAT libevent 2.0.21-stable
#'     ...
#'
#' The `version` bit is what we're after, but there are plenty of other
#' variables you could just as easily focus on if you use `memcached` in
#' any production capacity.
#'
#' I extracted raw version response data from our most recent scan for
#' open `memcached` servers on the internet. For ethical reasons, I cannot
#' blindly share the entire raw data set but hit up research@rapid7.com if
#' you have a need or desire to work with this data.
#'
#' Let's read it in:

#+ data
version_strings <- read_lines(here("data", "versions.txt"))

#' And, now take a look at it:

#+ explore
set.seed(2018-03-07)

sample(version_strings, 50)

#' It's in decent shape, but it needs some work if we're going to do a
#' version analysis with it. Let's clean it up a bit:

#+ cleanup
data_frame(
  string = stri_match_first_regex(version_strings, "STAT version (.*)$")[,2]
) -> versions

count(versions, string, sort = TRUE) %>%
  knitr::kable(format="markdown")

#' Much better! However, we really only need the major parts of the
#' [semantic version string](https://semver.org/) for a macro view, so
#' let's remove non-version strings completely and extract just the
#' _major_, _minor_ and _patch_ bits:

#+ moar_cleanup
filter(versions, !stri_detect_fixed(string, "UNKNOWN")) %>% # get rid of things we can't use
  mutate(string = stri_match_first_regex(
    string, "([[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+\\.[[:digit:]]+)")[,2] # for a macro-view, the discrete sub-versions aren't important
  ) -> versions

count(versions, string, sort = TRUE) %>%
  knitr::kable(format="markdown")

#' Much, much better! Now, let's dig into the versions a bit.

#' Using `semver` is dirt-simple. Just use `parse_version()` to get
#' the usable bits out:

#+ semver01
ex_ver <- semver::parse_version(head(versions$string[1]))

ex_ver

str(ex_ver)

#' It's a special class, referncing an external pointer (the package relies on
#' an underling C++ library and wraps everything up in a bow for us).
#'
#' These objects can be compared, ordered, sorted, etc but I tend to just
#' turn the parsed versions into a data frame that can be associated back
#' with the main strings. That way we keep things pretty tidy and have tons
#' of flexibility.

bind_cols(
  versions,
  pull(versions, string) %>%
    semver::parse_version() %>%
    as.data.frame()
) %>%
  arrange(major, minor, patch) %>%
  mutate(string = factor(string, levels = unique(string))) -> versions

versions

#' Now we have a tidy data frame and I did the extra step of creating an ordered
#' `factor` out of the version strings since they are ordinal values. With just
#' this step, we have everything we need to do a basic plot shoing the
#' version counts in-order:

count(versions, string) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_segment(
    aes(string, n, xend = string, yend = 0),
    size = 2, color = "lightslategray"
  ) +
  scale_y_comma() +
  labs(
    x = "memcached version", y = "# instances found",
    title = "Distribution of memcached versions"
  ) +
  theme_ipsum_ps(grid = "Y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, angle = 90))

#' That chart is informative on its own since we get the perspective that there
#' are some really old versions exposed. But, how old are they? Projects like
#' Chrome or Firefox churn through versions regularly/quickly (on purpose).
#' To make more sense out of this we'll need more info on releases.
#'
#' This is where things can get ugly for folks who do not have commercial
#' software management databases handy (or are analyzing a piece of software
#' that hasn't made it to one of those databases yet). The `memcached` project
#' maintains a [wiki page](https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/ReleaseNotes)
#' of version history that's mostly complete, and definitely complete enough for
#' this exercise. It _will_ some processing before we can associate a version
#' to a year.
#'
#' GitHub does not allow scraping of their site and --- off the top of my head ---
#' I do not know if there is a "wiki" API endpoint, but I _do_ know that you can
#' tack on `.wiki.git` to the end of a GitHub repo to clone the wiki pages, so
#' we'll use that knowledge and the `git2r` package to gain access to the
#' `ReleaseNotes.md` file that has the data we need:

td <- tempfile("wiki", fileext="git") # temporary "directory"

dir.create(td)

git2r::clone(
  url = "git@github.com:memcached/memcached.wiki.git",
  local_path = td,
  credentials = git2r::cred_ssh_key() # need GH ssh keys setup!
) -> repo

read_lines(file.path(repo@path, "ReleaseNotes.md")) %>%
  keep(stri_detect_fixed, "[[ReleaseNotes") %>%
  stri_replace_first_regex(" \\* \\[\\[.*]] ", "") %>%
  stri_split_fixed(" ", 2, simplify = TRUE) %>%
  as_data_frame() %>%
  set_names(c("string", "release_year")) %>%
  mutate(string = stri_trim_both(string)) %>%
  mutate(release_year = stri_replace_first_fixed(release_year, "(", "")) %>% # remove leading parens
  mutate(release_year = stri_replace_all_regex(release_year, "\\-.*$", "")) %>% # we only want year so remove remaining date bits from easy ones
  mutate(release_year = stri_replace_all_regex(release_year, "^.*, ", "")) %>% # take care of most of the rest of the ugly ones
  mutate(release_year = stri_replace_all_regex(release_year, "^[[:alpha:]].* ", "")) %>% # take care of the straggler
  mutate(release_year = stri_replace_last_fixed(release_year, ")", "")) %>% # remove any trailing parens
  mutate(release_year = as.numeric(release_year)) -> memcached_releases # make it numeric

unlink(td, recursive = TRUE) # cleanup the git repo we downloaded

memcached_releases

#' We have more versions in our internet-scraped `memcached` `versions` data
#' set than this wiki page has on it, so we need to restrict the official
#' release history to what we have. Then, we only want a single instance of
#' each year for the annotations, so we'll have to do some further processing:

filter(memcached_releases, string %in% unique(versions$string)) %>%
  mutate(string = factor(string, levels = levels(versions$string))) %>%
  group_by(release_year) %>%
  arrange(desc(string)) %>%
  slice(1) %>%
  ungroup() -> annotation_df

knitr::kable(annotation_df, "markdown")

#' Now, we're ready to add the annotation layers! We'll take a blind stab
#' at it before adding in further aesthetic customizations:

version_counts <- count(versions, string) # no piping this time

ggplot() +
  geom_blank(data = version_counts,aes(string, n)) + # prime the scales
  geom_vline(
    data = annotation_df, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(string)),
    size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted", color = "orange"
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = version_counts,
    aes(string, n, xend = string, yend = 0),
    size = 2, color = "lightslategray"
  ) +
  geom_label(
    data = annotation_df, aes(string, Inf, label=release_year),
    family = font_ps, size = 2.5, color = "lightslateblue",
    hjust = 0, vjust = 1, label.size = 0
  ) +
  scale_y_comma() +
  labs(
    x = "memcached version", y = "# instances found",
    title = "Distribution of memcached versions"
  ) +
  theme_ipsum_ps(grid = "Y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, angle = 90))

#' _Almost_ got it in ggpar 1! We need to tweak this so that the labels
#' do not overlap each other and do not obstruct the segment bars. We can
#' do most of this work in `geom_segment()` itself, plus add a bit of a tweal
#' to the Y axis scale:

ggplot() +
  geom_blank(data = version_counts,aes(string, n)) + # prime the scales
  geom_vline(
    data = annotation_df, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(string)),
    size = 0.5, linetype = "dotted", color = "orange"
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    data = version_counts,
    aes(string, n, xend = string, yend = 0),
    size = 2, color = "lightslategray"
  ) +
  geom_label(
    data = annotation_df, aes(string, Inf, label=release_year), vjust = 1,
    family = font_ps, size = 2.5, color = "lightslateblue", label.size = 0,
    hjust = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0),
    nudge_x = c(-0.1, 0.1, -0.1, -0.1, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1)
  ) +
  scale_y_comma(limits = c(0, 2050)) +
  labs(
    x = "memcached version", y = "# instances found",
    title = "Distribution of memcached versions"
  ) +
  theme_ipsum_ps(grid = "Y") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, angle = 90))

#' Now, we have version and year info to we can get a better idea of the scope
#' of exposure (and, just how much technical debt many organizations have accrued).
#'
#' With the ordinal version inforamtion we can also perform other statistical
#' operations as well. All due to the `semver` package.
